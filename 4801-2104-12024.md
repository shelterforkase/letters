I am not sure if I mentioned this before, but many moments of expressing an intense emotion or insightful epiphany have passed. Usually they happen whenever I do my chores or when I walk outside just to reorient myself, and not feel claustrophobic in my dorm room. Now that I am here, actually writing my thoughts down, my mind is blank, just like this page before any word or sentence is even written, and there is no strong urge to write anything. I lost that will.

Well, it sucks, but here I am now.

Do you know about a quote by that famous philosopher? I fail to recall if it's either Plato or Socrates, but they said, "An unexamined life is not worth living." I viscerally remember having to write a philosophy paper about this quote while I took an ethics class, with the thesis that I disagreed. Actually, this question is so dumb. You are so far away from here.

Now that time has passed since then, life happened to me. I still have not changed my mind about this stupid-ass quote. Obviously, there is that strong feeling of wanting to ask this philosopher: who is this bozo, feeling the need to tell people whether or not their lives are worth living or not? Is he an arbiter of what makes a life meaningful? Does he know how much suffering there is in life, that it really makes it hard for someone to even look into themselves? Into their past? How it hurts to see something painful or ugly?

While I could ask many questions about this quote about a meaningful and worthy life, I have realized one aspect of "examining" that I find valuable, and regret failing to do.

As much as it really hurts to do so, it is actually valuable seeing your past actions and experiences. One gains perspective with enough time and distance. Know what you did, what you could have done to make things better, and what would have been a waste to do regardless of whatever you could have done, whatever would have been in your favor, and whoever you were. Knowing what matters, and what does not. Knowing what pushed you to the precipice, and what launched you to the sky.

I was not a perfect person, but I know that I did work hard to belong, to be acknowledged, to be understood, and to be seen. I worked hard for the love from the people who were never going to love me. That hurts, but I can live through that pain. I will never forget about it, but I can try what remains of my life and time to seek better things.

This agony will not stop me to seize my happiness. I have dreams now. I want to make those dreams come true.

Now that I also have someone reading my letters, I should honor my promise of writing to you more often than not. I honestly I am not sure if you have been waiting for them or not. I know life must be so different from you out there. I am also not gonna pretend know what it is like for you. Your life, that is. I am also not gonna pretend to know more about you. I like that someone wants to listen to me, but I am too closed off and afraid to know about someone else, and end up liking them and wanting to be their friend. At least, not yet. I guess I am selfish like that. I wonder if there will ever come a time when that will change. I hope it will come.

Thank you for being there for me. Thank you for reading these letters.

Until next time.
