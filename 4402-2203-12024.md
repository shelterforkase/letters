I don't know why I remember... nothing. I understand that I am supposed to write something down and be able to produce something resembling a slice-of-life scenario, but nothing comes to mind. I could think of many scenarios, but I find myself refusing to even let my mind explore further. Well, if you know how my mind works, you probably already know that I know why, but... I can't help but ask.

What can I remember...

I remember the numbness after graduation. I know I'm not supposed to write about events that are big or important, but I am writing this down exactly because it did not feel big. I have the documents saying that I completed my coursework and my very own diploma saying I earned a degree, but it really did not feel like I graduated at all. I only felt like I did what I had to do, and I felt no sense of achievement. That is one thing I felt.

I don't know why I remember the small bonfire during the vacation I had with my relatives. It was beautiful. My face felt hot while my body was close to shivering from the coldness in the mountains. It was some fancy resort that my mother would spend a fortune on just to celebrate my graduation, but would give me an allowance that would force me to save money on food when it comes to my necessities.

I'm not liking what I wrote, but I guess that's how I feel.

This is a snippet to a mind of someone being abandoned, receiver. Do you at least imagine what you would feel if you were in my place? I know I must have not provided enough context, but I imagine you're smart enough to glean some vital information as to what I just gave away. Unless you're as dumb as I am.

Until next time.
